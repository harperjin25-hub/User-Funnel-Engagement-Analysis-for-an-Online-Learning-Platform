## User Funnel and Engagement Analysis (SQL + Tableau)

*This project analyzes end-to-end user behaviour across the full learning lifecycle for an online education platform. By combining SQL-based data processing with Tableau visualization, the project identifies drop-off points, engagement patterns, and opportunities to improve onboarding and content strategy.*

**🔍 Overview**

This project analyzes how users progress through the learning lifecycle—from onboarding to course engagement to certification. Using SQL and Tableau, the analysis uncovers engagement trends, conversion obstacles, and behavioural patterns that inform product and marketing decisions.

**🛠 Tech Stack**
### SQL
- Built complex queries for lifecycle segmentation and funnel analysis  
- Applied window functions (LAG/LEAD, ROW_NUMBER) to calculate user drop-off  
- Used CTEs and temporary tables to structure multi-step data transformations  
- Joined event-level and profile-level tables for a unified user view  
- Calculated engagement metrics, conversion KPIs, retention curves, and cohort-based insights

### Tableau
- Multi-tab dashboard development (Overview, Engagement, Cohorts, Exams, Learning modules)
- Cohort heatmaps for retention and lifecycle analysis
- Custom visual design: KPI cards, donut charts, bar charts, trend lines, scatterplots
