## User Funnel and Engagement Analysis (SQL + Tableau)

*This project analyzes end-to-end user behaviour across the full learning lifecycle for an online education platform. By combining SQL-based data processing with Tableau visualization, the project identifies drop-off points, engagement patterns, and opportunities to improve onboarding and content strategy.*
